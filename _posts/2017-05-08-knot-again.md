# Knot Again

Almost every sailing blog and sailing vlog contains a post or video about
useful knots aboard a sailboat and how they are used. Since this is such a
good starting point to this blog, I decided to do the same.

In this post, I'll go over 6 knots and bends:

* Bowline
* Clove Hitch
* Anchor Hitch
* Figure of Eight
* Sheet Bend
* Reef Knot
